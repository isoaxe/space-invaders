A version of the classic arcade game ‘Space Invaders’ programmed in the functional language Racket.

Open _space-invaders.rkt_ in Dr. Racket. To start the game, type `(main G0)` into the editor’s console. Use the arrow keys to move left and right, press the space bar to fire a missile. You will lose if an invader makes it’s way to the bottom of the screen.
