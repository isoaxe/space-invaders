A version of the classic arcade game ‘Space Invaders’ programmed in the functional language Racket.

Open space-invaders.rkt in Dr. Racket. To start the game, type (main G0) into the editor’s console. Use the arrow keys to move left and right, press the space bar to fire a missile. You will lose if an invader makes it’s way to the bottom of the screen.
